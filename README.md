# kiterope

Kiterope is a web application originally designed to function as a coaching application. Coaches could create programs with multiple steps that clients could subscribe to and receive scheduled tasks for them to complete. Completing a task requires either acknowledgement of completion, through a click, or the input of some sort of feedback, e.g. number of pushups completed. Kiterope would then allow the user to see his progress vs other people on the same plan. It also would allow the coach to modify the plan for the user based on his progress.

In this way, in a more generalized way, Kiterope functions as a next-generation to-do list - one that can be shared for groups of tasks that have multiple steps, need to be scheduled, have multimedia components, or have dependent/precedent logic.

Currently, I'm not doing any more development on it.
